Create a single html file based on the attached PSD.

### Markup
* Document markup should be well-formed and SEO-friendly. Use HTML5 where applicable.

### Styling
* CSS trickery is fine, but should degrade gracefully in older browsers.

### Interaction
* The button in the billboard should show a form to sign up to Spotify Premium.
* This doesn't have to be the entire signup form, but should contain some kind of client-side validation.
* How the form appears/looks etc is up to you. Be creative!
* You can use a framework of choice.

### General
* The page should be compatible with all major browsers (chrome, safari, firefox, opera, internet explorer 7+)

Looking forward to see what you cook up!

This is an original fork of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) boiled down to the basics.

### Why?:

Because the following is included:

1. Cross-browser compatible (IE6? Yeah, we got that.)
2. HTML5 ready. Use the new tags with certainty.
3. Optimal caching and compression rules for Grade-A performance
4. Best practice site configuration defaults
5. Think there's too much? The HTML5 Boilerplate is delete-key friendly. :)
6. Mobile browser optimizations
7. Progressive enhancement graceful degredation ........ yeah yeah we got that
8. IE-specific classes for maximum cross-browser control
9. Want to write unit tests but lazy? A full, hooked up test suite is waiting for you.
10. Javascript profilingâ€¦in IE6 and IE7? Sure, no problem.
11. Console.log nerfing so you won't break anyone by mistake.
12. Never go wrong with your doctype or markup!
13. An optimal print stylesheet, performance optimized
14. iOS, Android, Opera Mobile-adaptable markup and CSS skeleton.
15. IE6 pngfix baked in.
16. jQuery, waiting for you

17. Because I only have a couple of hours!
